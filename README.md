Implementation of a highly abstract framework for defining board games purely in code-behind. Will link to Godot for visualization later, for now the output just goes to the console.

## Credits
This project was heavily inspired by the board games in Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord specifically, hence using wolves and sheep vs the more traditional tigers and goats of the original Nepali Bagh Chal, for example.
